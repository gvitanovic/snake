# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

```

- Scan the QR code with Expo Go (iOS/Android) or run in a simulator/emulator.
- For web: press `w` in the Expo CLI and open in your browser.

## Build for Production

- [Expo build docs](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/)
- For app stores, use [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-build/introduction/).

## Code Style

- **Feature-based**: All logic, types, and styles for the snake game are in `/features/snake`.
- **Atomic design**: UI is split into atoms (Cell), molecules (Board), and organisms (PauseModal, NameInput).
- **Constants** are shared via `/constants`.
